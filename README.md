# TextRPG

This is a very simple text based RPG game that I created as part of a tutorial on Python. This is the first game I've ever made, and my first git repo. 

I'm sure there are bugs, if you find one please let me know so that it can be fixed. All suggestions on how to make the game more fun are welcome.
